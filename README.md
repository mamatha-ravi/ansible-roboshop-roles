Roboshop Deployment using Ansible Roles

Project Overview
This project automates the deployment of the Roboshop microservices application using Ansible Roles.
Roboshop is a cloud-native e-commerce application with multiple microservices like frontend, catalogue, cart, user, shipping, payment, and database services.
Tech Stack
* Ansible (Configuration Management)
* AWS EC2 (Infrastructure)
* Linux (RHEL)
* Node.js, Java, Python (Application services)
* MongoDB, MySQL, Redis,Rabbitmq (Databases)
* Nginx (Frontend)

1. Prerequisites (Manual Setup)
Before running the automation, you must manually set up a Management Node (Ansible Control Plane).
Launch an EC2 Instance.
Install Ansible:
sudo dnf install ansible -y

Configure AWS CLI:
Ensure the instance has the necessary IAM permissions or configure your credentials manually:
aws configure
Provide Access Key, Secret Key, and Default Region (e.g., us-east-1)

Use code with caution.

🐞 Troubleshooting

1. Connection Refused (Port Issue)
 Check service status:
netstat -lntp
systemctl status <service>
2. Service Not Starting
Check logs:
journalctl -u <service> -f
3. Inventory Not Working
ansible-inventory --list
4. Permission Issues
* Ensure log_path is writable

🧠 Learnings
* Hands-on experience with Ansible roles
* Real-time DevOps troubleshooting
* Microservices deployment automation
* Infrastructure + application integration
Future Enhancements

* CI/CD integration (Jenkins)
* Terraform for infra provisioning
* Kubernetes deployment
* Monitoring setup (Prometheus, Grafana)
